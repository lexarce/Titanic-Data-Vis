# Titanic Data Visualization Project

This project explores the socio-economic divides and survival outcomes of the Titanic disaster through interactive and visually engaging data visualizations. By analyzing survival rates across class, age, gender, and embarkation points, the project highlights the deep inequalities that shaped the fates of passengers aboard the Titanic.

## Project Features

**Interactive Visualizations:** Violin plots, heatmaps, network graphs, line charts, and radar charts provide insights into survival outcomes.  
**Data Analysis:** Survival rates broken down by class, age, gender, and embarkation points.  
**Story Narrative:** The visualizations are supported by data-driven storytelling that connects the Titanic's tragedy to broader themes of inequality in Edwardian society.

## Technologies Used

- **D3.js:** For creating interactive visualizations.  
- **JavaScript and HTML:** For building the visual interface.  
- **CSV Dataset:** Passenger data analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is derived from the Titanic dataset available at [Kaggle's Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset).  
It includes information such as passenger class, survival status, age, gender, ticket fare, and embarkation point.

## Visualizations

- **Violin Plot:** Compares survival rates by class, gender, embarkation port, age, and fare.  
- **Heatmap:** Highlights fatalities and embarkation points by location.  
- **Network Graph:** Analyzes relationships between class, gender, and survival outcomes.  
- **Line Graph:** Shows survival rates across different age ranges.  
- **Radar Chart:** Compares survival rates, average fares, and average ages by class.
