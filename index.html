                    <p>
                        The RMS Titanic, a marvel of engineering and luxury, set sail on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England to New York City on April 10, 1912.
                        Carrying over 2,200 passengers and crew of diverse social and economic backgrounds, the Titanic was the largest ship of its time and was considered unsinkable.
                        From the opulent First-Class cabins to the modest Third-Class acommodations, the Titanic was a microcosm of early 20th-century society, showcasing stark socio-economic divides.
                        <br><br>
                        But when disaster struck, these divides were more than just symbolic--they directly influenced survival rates.
                        The question of who survived and who perished was not just a matter of chance; it was shaped by class, wealth, age, gender, and other demographics.

                <h3>Understanding Socio-Economic Disparity</h3>
                <p>
                    The Titanic was a reflection of Edwardian society, where class and privilege dictated outcomes in life and death.
                    The wealthiest first-class passengers enjoyed luxurious accommodations and priority access to lifeboats, resulting in
                    a survival rate of <b>64%</b>, compared to just <b>24%</b> of third-class passengers, who were largely confined to the lower decks.
                    This stark divide mirrored the rigid social hierarchy of the time, where economic status determined one's opportunities
                    and chances of survival. The Titanic's tragic fate exposed the harsh inequalities of an era that valued wealth and social
                    standing above all else.

                <p>
                    When the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, only 700 our of more than 2,200 passengers survived.
                    Despite third-class passengers making up <b>55% of the total passenger population</b>, only <b>24%</b> of the survivors cames from
                    third-class while <b>63% of first-class passengers</b> survived. Women and children, especially in upper classes, had significantly
                    higher chances of survival, reflecting the "women and children first" policy. Meanwhile, third-class men and older passengers faced
                    overwhelming disadvantages, with survival rates plummeting to as low as <b>20%</b> for some age groups.
                    <br><br>
                    The embarkation points reveal the diverse backgrounds of those abroad, from wealthy elites departing Cherbourg to hopeful immigrants embarking
                    Queenstown. The Titanic, as a reflection of its time, laid bare the harsh realities of wealth inequality and social hierarchy, where one's 
                    fate was determined by their socio-economic status. Through these data visualizations, we gain not only a clearer understanding of the tragic
                    loss of life but also a deeper appreciation for the human stories behind the statistics.
