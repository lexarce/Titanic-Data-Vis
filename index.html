                    <p>
                        The RMS Titanic, a marvel of engineering and luxury, set sail on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England to New York City on April 10, 1912.
                        Carrying over 2,200 passengers and crew of diverse social and economic backgrounds, the Titanic was the largest ship of its time and was considered unsinkable.
                        From the opulent First-Class cabins to the modest Third-Class acommodations, the Titanic was a microcosm of early 20th-century society, showcasing stark socio-economic divides.
                        <br><br>
                        But when disaster struck, these divides were more than just symbolic--they directly influenced survival rates.
                        The question of who survived and who perished was not just a matter of chance; it was shaped by class, wealth, age, gender, and other demographics.

                <p>
                    The Violin Graph provides a lens into how age and ticket fare were distributed among passenger classes on the Titanic.
                    These variables hint at the socio-economic disparities that shaped the passengers' journeysâ€”and their fates. 
                    Let's dive into the first visualization to uncover the patterns.

                <p>
                    The graph highlights clear disparities: First-Class passengers were generally older and paid significantly higher fares, 
                    while Third-Class passengers were younger with much lower fares. These differences reflect socio-economic status, 
                    influencing access to resources during the disaster.
